# Metaheuristics
The project is a study of the effectiveness of modern metaheuristics in embedding information in digital images.

For ease of use and testing of metaheuristic algorithms, they will be laid out separately from the main project code.

It is supposed to implement such metaheuristics as: SCA, TLBO, ICA, WOA, SSA, AOA and benchmark functions to them.

Currently implemented: ICA, SCA, TLBO and SSA.
